# **Heimdallr**
>__**Multipurpose, Functional, Ever watching**__
>*Notice*: This repo is a complete rewrite of Heimdallr built upon [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) and [Commando](https://github.com/discordjs/Commando). The previous build on discord.js is no longer being maintained at this time. Some fuctionality may no longer be compatible due to the API in use (e.g. Imgur with NSFW photos).

Heimdallr is an all in one Discord bot built with server functionality in mind. From easy fun to server administration Heimdallr aims to be the only bot you need. Enjoy the plethora of commands at your disposal whilst it guards the realms.

**Why Heimdallr:**
* Easy Server Management and Logging.
* Provide additonal features to your users.
* Enguage your community in new exciting ways.
* Peace of mind the frost giants are being held in check.

## Features
* Set a custom prefix
* Starboard functionality
* Reputation System
* Moderation tools to kick some ass when needed (Kick, Ban, Mute, etc)
* Search movies, anime, managa, games, and more
* Fun and interactive commands for user enguagment
* NSFW features for deviants with the ability to disable

## Guild setup

Once you invite Heimdall to your server you will need to do a little setup if you wish to use all the features it has to offer. Firstly if you want a custom prefix input `@Heimdall prefix <prefix>`. After that you can run the `setup` command to configure everything. Alternatively you can run each setup function on its own find out more with the `help` command. To set a starboard outside the setup use the `starboard` command. Any problems you encounter feel free to contact via our [discord](https://discord.gg/9gDgF6).

## Self-hosting
We highly encourage you to invite this bot over self-hosting. Self-hosting aka running the bot provided within this repo on your own is permitted but not supported. Source code is provided in the interest of being open with our community. Ultimately no help or guidance will be provided for setup, editing, or any actions from running the bot within your own self-hosted enviroment. You are more then welcome to join the support server but understand any issues or questions stemming from self-hosting may be ignored or disregarded entirely. If you still wish to continue to self host the bot you will need at the very least the following:

* Discord Developer Application
* Node v12.0.0+
* PostgrSQL or MongoDB
* Creation of .env file
* API keys used for services

> *Notice*: Repeated requests for aid with self-hosting will lead to a ban from the support server.
